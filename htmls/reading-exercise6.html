        One day, the king of the jungle was asleep under a shady tree where he lived. A small, lost mouse was passing by. He saw the sleeping lion. The mouse tried to go around the lion. His tail touched the lion’s paw and the lion awoke. The lion was very angry at the mouse. He caught him between his claws and shouted at him.

        “How dare you touch me? Do you know who I am? I will eat you!”
        “Please, don’t kill me. I can help you whenever you need it!” replied the mouse.
        The lion laughed loudly.
        “How could a tiny mouse ever help me?” he laughed. “Alright, I’ll let you go this time. Only because you made me laugh.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        A few days later, the same lion found himself caught in a hunter’s net. He shouted for help.
        The mouse heard the lion. He came running to save him. The mouse saw that the lion was trapped. He used his teeth to bite the net. The lion was free. He thanked his friend for saving him. He understood that no matter what anyone looked like, they could do great things.
